    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <h3>Why Loom & Light Exists</h3>
    <p>At <strong>Loom & Light</strong>, we believe that interior design is more than aesthetics — it’s an emotional connection to space. Your home is where your story unfolds: where routines are built, memories are made, and identities take shape. Our mission is to design interiors that not only look stunning but also feel lived-in, warm, and uniquely yours.</p>
    <p>We exist for the homeowners who value craft, calm, and character. For those who want their spaces to speak softly, yet leave a lasting impression. Whether it’s a single room or an entire home, our purpose is to bring depth and warmth through thoughtful styling — combining texture, tone, and soul.</p>

    <h3>How We Work</h3>
    <p>Our design approach is personal, collaborative, and detail-oriented. We start by listening — to your lifestyle, your inspirations, and how you want your space to feel. Every project begins with a conversation, followed by curated concept boards, mood-driven palettes, and considered spatial planning.</p>
    <p>At Loom & Light, we blend natural materials, timeless furnishings, and purposeful design choices. Our styling is never trend-led; instead, we create layered interiors that feel effortless and evolve gracefully over time. Every finish, textile, and accent is chosen with care — ensuring your space feels both luxurious and livable.</p>
    <p>We work with trusted craftspeople, sustainable suppliers, and independent artisans to bring authenticity into every room. Whether you're reimagining a period property or refreshing a modern build, we’ll tailor our process to suit your vision, timeline, and budget.</p>

    <h3>When It All Began</h3>
    <p>Loom & Light was founded in early <strong>2025</strong>, born from a lifelong love of interiors and a desire to slow the pace of modern living through beautiful, calming spaces. What began as a passion project evolved into a full-service interior styling studio — shaped by experience, creativity, and a deep appreciation for how homes make us feel.</p>
    <p>In our first year, we worked on a diverse range of homes — from countryside cottages to urban apartments — each one an opportunity to explore new textures, stories, and design ideas. Today, Loom & Light continues to grow through word-of-mouth and meaningful client relationships, built on trust, transparency, and results that speak for themselves.</p>
