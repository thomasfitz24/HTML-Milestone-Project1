      <h2>How We Started</h2>
      <p>
        Loom & Light was born out of a shared love for harmony, texture, and timeless beauty in the spaces we call home. What started as a simple hobby between two close friends evolved into a fully-fledged design studio, dedicated to bringing warmth and sophistication into everyday living.  
        <br><br>
        Our journey began with hands-on experience—restoring furniture, experimenting with color palettes, and layering lighting schemes to evoke emotion. We worked late nights, juggled day jobs, and took on our first clients one room at a time. The feedback was clear: people craved interiors that felt personal, meaningful, and curated with intent. So we stepped into the space with our own approach—calm, collaborative, and rooted in authenticity.  
        <br><br>
        Over the years, our vision has grown, but our values have stayed the same. Each project starts with listening. We ask questions, sketch possibilities, and build trust with every exchange. Whether it’s a minimalist loft or a countryside cottage, our goal remains constant: create interiors that reflect real life, not just a showroom ideal.

      <h2>Why We Do It</h2>
      <p>
        At Loom & Light, we believe that interior design should do more than look good—it should feel right. A home is not just a space; it’s an atmosphere that shapes our mindset, our relationships, and our routines. That belief drives everything we do.  
        <br><br>
        We create for people who value intention. We design for those who want their surroundings to tell a story—of where they’ve been, what they love, and how they live. Every fabric, fixture, and finish is chosen with care, not because it’s trendy, but because it fits the rhythm of the home and the soul of its owners.  
        <br><br>
        Our clients come to us for more than aesthetics. They seek design that works—beautiful yet functional, refined yet welcoming. We’re here to guide, advise, and translate ideas into spaces that offer clarity, warmth, and balance. It’s not about imposing a style—it’s about uncovering the one that’s already there and helping it flourish.

      <h2>When It All Began</h2>
      <p>
        The seed for Loom & Light was planted in 2019, in a tiny workshop with uneven floors and more paint samples than shelf space. It was a humble beginning—just us, our tools, and a belief that design could be slower, more human, and more meaningful.  
        <br><br>
        We worked with local artisans, scoured vintage markets, and poured ourselves into each build. Slowly, our studio grew. Word spread not through ads, but through recommendations from clients who appreciated our care and commitment. By 2021, Loom & Light had evolved into a boutique studio with projects across the UK and beyond.  
        <br><br>
        Today, we continue to expand while staying close to our roots. We remain independent, passionate, and fiercely committed to the craft of design that uplifts and endures. As we look to the future, our mission is clear: keep creating homes that feel as good as they look, one thoughtful detail at a time.
